-I decided to just use two separate min and max fields for the compenstation
range, just to make things simpler/be compatible with DBs that don't have
support a range type.

-The :skills field for JobCast is treated as serialized text array, to 
avoid making a new model for what might be an arbitrary list of words.

-there are 2 methods which return HTML pages (for convenience):
GET /model_name/new => display form for creating new record
GET /model_name/:id/edit => display form for editing
(you can comment out the 'format.hmtl' line in Controller#index to get an HTML
page for the list, i.e. index, action)

-below I give the three models at the center of the service, and outline
the relationships between them:

Organization: has_many JobCasts
  -an organization can create/own many JobCasts at the same time

Individual: has_and_belongs_to_many JobCasts
  -one person may be matched with many JobCasts at the same time,
  but a JobCast may also have many people matched to it

JobCast: has_and_belongs_to_many JobCasts, belongs_to Organization
  -one person may be matched with many JobCasts at the same time,
  but a JobCast may also have many people matched to it
  -as above, a JobCast belongs to exactly one Organization
